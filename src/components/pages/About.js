            <p>
            My name is Madalyne Cross, I am a Full Stack developer. I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Rice University. As a classically-trained musician and experienced educator, my strengths include breaking down complex tasks, attention to detail, a passion for learning and helping others achieve excellence. When I am not developing or learning, you can find me in a CrossFit class, cooking or traveling. I am excited to bring my creativity, dedication and technical skills to a company to grow and become a valuable asset.
